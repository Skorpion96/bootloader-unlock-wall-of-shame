Devices Until Android 11 with engineering firmware:<br/>

There is also a chance that your device is vulnerable to one of the MTK or Unisoc [exploits](../../README.md#universal-soc-based-methods).

About ZTE unisoc models pre android 10, ZTE used a custom signature for boot, vbmeta, recovery and system meaning that without an engineering firmware flashing magisk would lead to bootloop, in the same way patching vbmeta as described on [hovatek-vbmeta] does the same thing, same if you try to patch recovery. Android 11 models don't have this problem, but them can only be rooted by magisk, vbmeta has a custom signature and editing super leads to bootloop. On android 13 ZTE blocked the unlock [unlock-block]

Side note, on the A11 link there is a collection of apps to grant a system shell, but they would probably only work on old models.
